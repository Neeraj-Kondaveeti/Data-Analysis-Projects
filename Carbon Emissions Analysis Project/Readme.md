## Key Technologies

### 1. SQL
SQL is used extensively for querying and managing relational databases. Projects demonstrate:
- Advanced querying techniques including subqueries, joins, CTEs, and window functions.
- Data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes.
- Database optimization and performance tuning.

### 2. Python
Python is leveraged for data manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization using:
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and Scikit-learn.
- **Applications**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), machine learning models, and hypothesis testing.

### 3. Tableau
Interactive dashboards are created using Tableau to:
- Visualize complex datasets with clarity and precision.
- Enable stakeholders to explore trends, patterns, and insights dynamically.
- Generate compelling stories around data-driven decisions.
